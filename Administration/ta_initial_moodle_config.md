This is a task I usually assign a TA at the beginning of the term.

# Making Moodle Groups

To make a moodle group:

1. Click on the gear in the top right corner by the course title and
   select "More..."
2. Select the "Users" tab underneath the big "Course Administration"
   heading
3. Select groups
4. You can now create groups with the "Create Group" link.  Once
   created you can select Add/remove users to add and remove users

Make 2 types of groups

1.  Groups for CS and SE majors.  For multi-majors, use the first major
2.  Groups for each section of the course

To do these you'll need the course roster from me

# Updating the calendar

The various assignments should already be created on Moodle.  BUT
their due dates do not correspond to the due dates on the course
schedule.

To fix:

1. Press Ctrl+Alt E to enter editing mode
2. For each assignment select "Edit settings"
3. Set the due date to the given day at 23:55
4. Set the cut-off date to 4 hours later (approx)
