Answer the questions posted in the instructions here.

Question 1: 

(a)What error is received?
    Currently the error received is a segmentation fault.

(b)Where (what line number and which instruction) is the error received?
    This error is received at in the function fgetline at line 30 in file-functions.c. The instruction which seems to error
    is fgets(line, max, file) in the if loop conditional.

Problem 2: What is the root cause of the error in Problem 1? 
    Newline in fgetlines does not allocate memory for itself.

Problem 3:
    Assigned a calloc to the newline in fgetlines function which allocates memory it needs.
