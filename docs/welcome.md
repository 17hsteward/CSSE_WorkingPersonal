## Greetings 
Welcome to CSSE 332 for the Spring quarter of 2020-21, sections 03 and 04. It is my pleasure to work
with you on this class and I hope that we will have a great quarter together. Below you can find a
short (well, shortish video) in which I introduce myself and how our class will operate going
forward. Please note that this video is a bit longer than what you will normally see in this class,
but since it only contains logistics information, I thought it would be fine to just record it all
in one piece. 

Note: If you prefer to use Panopto, you can find the video
[here](https://rose-hulman.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=be39f49c-1b49-4289-a866-ace7002cbaec)

## TL;DR
- My name is Mohammad, please call me Mohammad (not a big fan of titles)
- This class is about operating systems, it is my favorite class
- We will be doing a mixed version of online and in-person teaching (that I called `Sublime hybrid
teaching`. why? because of [Hegel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel))
- Basically, you will have videos to refer to: those videos will be < 40 minutes in length
- You will come to class 4 times a week
  - We will do < 10 minutes of in-class demo/discussion
  - For a total of 45 minutes of lecturing, just like a normal class
- Remaining 40 minutes of class time are work time
- __Bookmark__ the [schedule page]({{ site.baseurl }}/schedule)
  - I have released a couple of exercises to refresh your memory on C pointers. Those are due on
      Friday at 11:59 pm. You can find more details [here]({{ site.baseurl
      }}/docs/00_pointer_practice).
- __Please ask a lot of questions__
- I hope you'll love this class as much as I do

### How to get in touch
- Use this [link](https://calendly.com/mnoureddine) to get on my calendar (or little box at the bottom of the page)
- Best way to reach me without an appointment is through Teams, though expect some delays depending
on my schedule
