Just a few notes for graders

# How to checkout student code

Get the initial assignment code by checking out the course github
(should be where you're reading this doc).

1. Go to the Moodle for the course and click the assignment on the main page
2. Look for the Assignment Administration menu and click "Download all submissions"
3. Download the zip file someplace handy

I've asked the students to submit all source files (e.g. including
stuff they didn't modify, but that may be wishful thinking so you
might have to copy all missing files into their repos...hint: cp 
has a --no-clobber parameter).

# How to enter grades

1. Assignments are on Moodle (but you can use the Moodle spreadsheet
   system if you prefer)
2. Don't just rely on unit tests, but don't make yourself crazy
3. Always enter feedback, especially when you take off points
4. Always enter 0s for unsubmitted work (if it's wrong, the student
   will get in contact)

# General grading guidance

Most of your assignments should have rubrics BUT here's a general
guideline:


| Credit %    | Amount of functionality                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Full credit | Behaves as specifies                                                 |
| 80%         | One “very small” error that the included test code does not evidence |
| 50%   | A small error the test code does detect (here we deduct points not so much for the mistake itself, but for the fact that the student was unable to fix the mistake despite tests)  |
| 25%         | A more or less correct approach but parts missing                    |
| 0%          | A “large” error or more than one error                               |


# Regrade Requests

1. Initially go through you
2. Be really polite and not aggressive
3. But if anything is weird, immediately escalate via email to the
   professor (and 'cc the student)

# General Guidance

1. Always get paid for all your time, including small breaks and
   working with students
2. Be really nice, but escalate as soon as it gets beyond your pay
   grade
