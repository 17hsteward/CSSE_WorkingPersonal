### Course Description

Students learn fundamental concepts of modern operating systems by studying how and why operating systems have evolved. Topics include CPU scheduling, process synchronization, memory management, file systems, I/O systems, privacy and security, and performance evaluation. Students implement parts of an operating system as a means of exploring the details of some of these topics.

### Prerequisite Topics

It is assumed that students are familiar with the C programming language and are well on their way to being independent programmers (i.e. they have a solid command of the material in CSSE-220 or CSSE-221). It is also assumed that students have an understanding of the material covered in CSSE-132 or CSSE-232 including interrupts and exceptions, the relationship between high-level languages and assembly code, and processor resources such as registers.

### Textbook

#### Required

* Operating System Concepts, 9th Edition, Abraham Silberschatz, Greg Gagne, and Peter B. Galvin, Wiley, 2012.

* Unless otherwise specified, all Chapters and Sections listed on the schedule refer to Operating System Concepts.

#### Other References

* C Programming Language, 2nd Edition, Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, Prentice Hall, 1988.

* C: The Complete Reference, 4th Edition, Herbert Schildt, McGraw-Hill Osborne Media, 2000.

* Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment, 2nd Edition, W. Richard Stevens and Stephen A. Rago, Addison-Wesley Professional, 2008.

#### Electronic Course Materials

* Electronic course materials, including the schedule, may be accessed directly at:
[https://rhit-csse.github.io/csse332](https://rhit-csse.github.io/csse332).

* All grades and assignment feedback will posted on Moodle.

* Posting questions, discussions, and answers to questions asked are best done on the course’s Piazza site.

### Reading Assignments

It would be to your benefit to do the reading assignments before they are covered in class so we can devote class time to discussing difficult ideas and algorithms. You are responsible for all the material in the assigned sections of the book, whether explicitly discussed in class or not.

### Deadlines and Late Policy

The deadlines of all homeworks, labs, and project milestones are listed on on the [schedule](https://rhit-csse.github.io/csse332/schedule.html) page.

In general, you should plan ahead and submit assignments on time. This course has no ’late day’ policy and late assignments are generally worth 0 points unless you have made special arrangements.

However we understand that situations can arise. We handle all situations on a case-by-case basis. Here are some general guidelines:

* We expect to be notified as soon as is feasible. If you are very ill, we understand that that might be slightly after the assignment due date. For other situations, it’s usually possible to notify us in advance.
* The usual extension we will provide is 24 hours. Occasionally we may allow 48 hours. More than that is very unlikely.
* We keep track of extensions per student and if you seem to be overusing the privilege we will stop allowing extensions.
* If the reason you are late is because you are having trouble completing the assignment (e.g. a bug you can’t fix or just difficulty understanding) get help from an instructor. Don’t assume that more time will fix the problem; plan to get help.

### Homework

Homework assignments are listed on the class schedule. Some homework assignments require code solutions and submission instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/RHIT-CSSE/csse332/blob/master/Docs/getting_and_submitting_code.md). Others involve paper and pencil solutions and will be handed in during class. Submission instructions are included in each homework assignment. Be sure to include your name and any other required information (e.g. collaboration) in each submission.

### Quizzes

In class quizzes may be given throughout the term. Quizzes will be distributed at the beginning of class and will be picked up at the end of the lecture.

In classes quizzes cannot be made up. However, we will drop your 2 lowest quiz grades.

### Laboratories

The labs labs are listed on the on the schedule.

### Exams

There will be two midterm exams. Exams will be reviewed in class.

### Project

During the second half of the course you will build a bare metal operating system. The project description and requirements can be found on the course web page. You will work in teams of four. During weeks 5–10 there will be scheduled project milestones to be delivered by each team. The project will be due in its complete and tested form during the tenth week of the quarter. The project presentations (with accompanying demonstrations) will be held during the tenth week.

You must complete the project to pass the course.

### Programming Problems

Some of the homework, all of the labs, part of each exam, and the final project require programming solutions. Each student is expected to be able to design, build, execute and debug solutions for problems of similar scope.


### Grading

Item                          | Weight
:----------------------------- |:-------
Quizzes and in class exercises|	5%
Homework and Labs|	25%
Exams|	30%
Final Project|	40%

Generally, 90-100% is an A, 80-89% is a B, etc.

*NOTE: You must have at least **65%** as the average of the programming portions in the exams to pass the course.*

### Collaboration, Cheating and Professional Behavior

Collaboration is encouraged on homework and laboratories. It is prohibited on all quizzes and exams. When you collaborate, you must properly credit your collaborators and clearly indicate the extent of the collaboration. Working out a solution as a group is acceptable collaboration. Each individual is responsible for understanding the entire solution. For homework, this means that once a group solution has been achieved, each collaborator must rework the problem and write up the solution independently. Copying is not collaboration. Failure to properly acknowledge collaboration can be considered cheating.

Students found to have cheated will be penalized up to -150% of the value of the assignment (yes, that’s a negative grade, beyond a simple 0). This is in addition to cheating being reported and added to your permanent file.

Students are expected to behave professionally. A lack of professional behavior in a student’s interactions within a team, with an instructor, teaching assistants or during in-class activities can result in a penalty grade. Depending on the nature and the egregiousness of the behavior, the penalty grade might be a reduction in letter grade or an F in the class.
