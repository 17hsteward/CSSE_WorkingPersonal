# Introduction and aim
In this session, we will concretely define threads and learn how to use the `pthreads` library. We
will conduct a speed test to compare multithreading vs multiprocessing. Finally, we will take a look
at what are some common issues with multi-threaded applications so we can set up our dive into
concurrency.

## Logistics
* [Slides]()
* [Class notebook section]()
* [Activity submission](https://moodle.rose-hulman.edu/mod/assign/view.php?id=2708154)
* [Clear/Muddy survey](https://moodle.rose-hulman.edu/mod/quiz/view.php?id=2785929)

In-class activity and clear/muddy survey are due on Friday before the start of session 18.
